## What is the Spiker:bit? ## 
The Spiker:bit allows you to develop DIY Brain Machine Interfaces (BMI) or sometimes called Brain Computer Interfaces (BCI).  A BMI is a computers that interfaces directly with the electrical signals of your body. The Spiker:bit has a port to connect to a micro:bit (computer), and a port to record from your body.  

## Technical Specifications ##

## Hardware Overview ## 
The Spiker:bit has a slot that accepts a V1 or V2 micro:bit.  The electrode required for recording is our orange cable with 3 leads (2 recording electrodes and a ground).

You can select between EMG (Muscle) or EKG (Heart) on the Signal Select switch.  A Servo controller is provided on PIN 8. There is also an expansion port on the bottom to get clean access to additional pins for your project.

## What Will You Need? ##

To get started, you will need:

* 3x BYB Large Muscle Electrodes
* 1x BYB Orange Electrode Cable
* 1x Spiker:bit
* 1x micro:bit

Connect the micro:bit to the front slot on the Spiker:bit.  Be sure that the LEDs are facing outwards. Connect the orange cable to the electrode on the Spiker:bit side port.

 You are now ready to start programming your Spiker:bit.   The following tutorials will get you started.  We have tutorials for [Block Code](./Block), [Python](./Python).  The [Block Code](./Block) is the easiest way to get started.

## Experiments and Tutorials ## 

To get started on programming the Spiker:bit, take a look at the [Getting Started with Block Programming](./Block/) or [Getting Started with Python](./Python/). To see how this can be used in a real-world project, take a look at the [DIY Hand Neuroprosthetic](./DIY_Hand_Neuroprosthetic) page.
