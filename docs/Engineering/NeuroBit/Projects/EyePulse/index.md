# Overview #
Welcome to project Eye Pulse where you can have experiment with eye blink detection in REAL TIME!!. This project uses a pair of Micro:Bit and Neuro:Bit. We will utilze muscle movenemnt from your eyes and EOG filtering to catch your eyeblinks!!

## Check supplies ##
For this project, you would need following material

1. Micro:bit
2. Neuro:bit
3. Cable
4. Three Electrodes

## Know where to place electrodes ##
Once you are ready to place your electrodes, first, choose which side you want to place the electrodes at.

Place first electrode on outer canthus of whichever side you choose.

Place second electode just below the eye. Also choose side of the eye you pick.

Place last electrode behind the ears where you can feel the bone. This also must be the same side of the eye you choose.
We refer this as "Ground" electrodes which is important for noise reduction from signal.

## Connecting right cables to right place ##
Take a look at the red colored aligator clips. If you see the black dot, place it on the electrodes located below the eye. 

Second red aligator clops (one with no black dot) will be placed on the electrode located outer cathus. 

The black colored aligator clips will be placed on the "Ground" electrodes.(located behind the ear)

Don't see the black dot? 
  No worries! Just place your red clips randomly and black on the behind the ear. We will show how to check the correct placement later.  

Pro Tip:
  If you don't see the black dot or you got confuse which one is which, you can always check with device that allows to to check the connectivity of electric flow. For example: Digital Multimeter(DMM).

  Here are the instructions if you are interested: 
  
  1. Grab positive cable (usually a red colored) and clip the red aligator clip.
  2. Grab negative cable (usually a black colored) and slides over the audio jack port
  3. If you have done it correctly, you should be able to know which part of the audiojack port corresponds to the red aligator tip. (In case of DMM, you would hear the sound of beep)
  4. If the device signals you at the edge of audiojack, this will NOT BE a black-dotted red aligator clip. (Also known as non-inverting input voltage) Therefore, it should be placed at outer cathus of the eye.
  5. If the device signals you at the middle of audiojack this will BE a black-dotted red aligator clip. (Also known as inverting input voltage) Therefore, it should be placed at bottom of the eye.
