# FOMO Glasses #

This project is a labor of love in two parts. First, this is a conversion of the Blink:Bit's code from python into makecode for enabling bluetooth. Second, the micro:bit's bluetooth currently has no online documentation. Our hope is that the explanation here will illuminate how bluetooth works and how you can pair the micro:bit and our new electrophysiology abilities with other devices. 

Explanation of Bluetooth
- Why was it chosen / needed instead of radio?
- Trickyness, explanations of each code line
-
