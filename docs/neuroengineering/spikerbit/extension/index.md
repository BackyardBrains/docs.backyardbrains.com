## Installing the Spiker:bit Extension in Microsoft MakeCode ##

We will use the **[Make Code editor](https://makecode.microbit.org/)**, developed by Microsoft for the **micro:bit**, to program our Brain-Machine Interfaces (BMIs). There are other editors available, but we will discuss those and their differences later in **"Getting Started with Python"**. 

Installing the **Spiker:bit** extension in the MakeCode editor is now easier than ever: **Backyard Brains** is officially listed in the MakeCode Extensions Library.
Follow these simple steps to add the **Spiker:bit extension** to your project.
