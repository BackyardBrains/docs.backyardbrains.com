# Instructions # 

Nicotine Solution Prep
  Rip off the filter by pinching and pulling.
  Put the filter-less cigarette in a 10 mL falcon tube.
  Fill the tube with saline up to the 10 mL mark.
  Let it soak for at least overnight to get the nicotine out.
  Get Ready to Inject:
  After 24 hours, use a syringe to take out 0.03 mL of the nicotine solution.

MSG Solution:
  Fill the tube with saline up to the 10 mL mark.
  Shake the tube until the MSG is completely dissolved.
  
Cricket Prep:
  Put a cricket in the freezer for about 3 minutes. Too short, and it won't be sleepy; too long, and it might not make it.
Place the Electrodes:
  Once the cricket is sleepy, put one electrode in its abdomen.
  Place the second electrode two spiracles away from the first one.
Set Up the Spikerbox:
  Turn on the spikerbox and connect it to the tablet or smartphone.
  Wait about 2 minutes for the cricket to wake up.
  Blow gently on its abdomen to make sure it's awake. You should see spikes on the app if it is.

Injecting and Observing
Inject the Solutions:
  Inject one cricket with 0.03 mL of the nicotine solution.
  Inject another cricket with 0.03 mL of the MSG solution.
  Inject a third cricket with 0.03 mL of plain saline as a control.
Watch the Neuronal Response:
  Observe the cricket's neuronal activity on the app.
  Record any changes in spike frequency or patterns after injection.

Safety and Ethical Stuff
  Wear gloves and safety goggles when preparing and injecting solutions.
  Dispose of syringes and biological materials properly.
Be Kind to Crickets:
  Talk about the ethical use of animals in research.
  Make sure students understand the importance of treating the crickets humanely and minimizing their discomfort.
