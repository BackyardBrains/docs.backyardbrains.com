# Experiment: Neural Recording from Fiddler Crab

## Introduction

This experiment will allow students to explore how neurons in the leg of a fiddler crab encode and transmit information. By recording the electrical activity of these neurons, students will gain insights into the basic principles of neurobiology and electrophysiology.

## Background

### The Nervous System
The nervous system is the command center of the body. It senses the environment, communicates information to different parts of the body, and controls actions. Neurons, the specialized cells that make up the nervous system, use electrical signals to pass information rapidly. This experiment will focus on recording these electrical signals, known as action potentials or "spikes."

### Neurons in the Crab Leg
In fiddler crabs, neurons in the leg are responsible for sensing touch and movement. These sensory neurons help the crab detect changes in its environment, which is crucial for survival. By examining these neurons, we can learn how sensory information is encoded and transmitted to the brain.

### Electrophysiology
Electrophysiology is a method used by scientists to detect and amplify small electrical changes in biological tissues. By recording these electrical signals, we can study the activity of neurons in real-time.

## Materials

- Fiddler crabs
- Plastic container with wet sand or marsh mud
- Saltwater
- Pellet or flake fish food
- Ice
- Plastic cup
- Corkboard
- SpikerBox
- Electrodes
- Toothpick
- Recording device (computer, tablet, or smartphone)
- Spike Recorder app

## Procedure

### Obtaining and Caring for Fiddler Crabs
1. **Collecting Crabs:** Collect fiddler crabs at low tide in a marsh or purchase them from bait and tackle shops.
2. **Setting Up Habitat:** Place wet sand or marsh mud in a plastic container, covering about two-thirds of the bottom, and fill the rest with saltwater.
3. **Maintaining Habitat:** Keep extra saltwater on hand to replenish as needed to prevent dehydration.
4. **Feeding Crabs:** Feed the crabs with pellet or flake fish food twice a week.

### Preparing the Specimen
1. **Anesthetizing the Crab:** Place a fiddler crab in a plastic cup filled with ice to anesthetize it.
2. **Removing a Leg:** After a few minutes, remove the crab from the ice and gently pull off one of its legs from the base of the carapace.
3. **Setting Up the Leg:** Place the leg on the corkboard with part of it hanging off the edge.

### Recording Electrical Activity
1. **Inserting Electrodes:** Insert the electrodes into the leg, one at the top of the femur and the other at the bottom of the femur near the knee joint.
2. **Connecting Equipment:** Connect the SpikerBox to your recording device and open the Spike Recorder app.
3. **Recording Activity:** Flip the “ON” switch on the SpikerBox and observe the neuron's action potentials in real-time.
4. **Stimulating the Leg:** Use a toothpick to gently poke the leg and observe changes in electrical activity.

### Data Analysis
1. **Recording Spontaneous Activity:** Record the spontaneous electrical activity of the neuron.
2. **Recording Stimulated Activity:** Record the electrical activity when the leg is stimulated with different stimuli (taps, pulls, air blows).
3. **Analyzing Spikes:** Identify and count the action potentials, noting the different phases of the action potential (depolarization, repolarization, hyperpolarization).

## Post-Activity Questions
1. What is the nervous system and how does it communicate?
2. How do neurons generate and transmit electrical signals?
3. What differences in electrical activity do you observe between spontaneous and stimulated conditions?

## Conclusion
By conducting this experiment, students will learn how neurons in the fiddler crab's leg encode sensory information and how electrophysiology can be used to study neural activity. This hands-on activity provides a practical understanding of neurobiology principles and the fascinating mechanisms of neuronal communication.
