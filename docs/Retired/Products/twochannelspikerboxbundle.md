### Description

This is the kit version of our [2-Channel SpikerBox](twochannelspikerbox.md). 
It includes a [Laptop Cable](laptopcable.md) so you can record data on your 
computer and a [Faraday Cage](faradaycage.md) for noise-free recordings. 
These are essential components in our **earthworm conduction velocity** 
experiments.

What can you do with **2 Channels**?  
You can record from multiple neural sources at once, or measure conduction 
velocity using earthworms—**How fast do action potentials travel?**  
Now you can find out!

### Product Details

This expanded version of our original [SpikerBox](spikerbox.md) is just as 
easy to use. Connect the included [Laptop Cable](laptopcable.md) or 
[Smartphone Cable](smartphonecable.md) to listen to spikes on an external 
speaker or watch them on your smartphone, iPad, or computer.

You can do all the same experiments the single-channel SpikerBox can do. 
However, the **2-Channel SpikerBox** also lets you measure the same spike 
at **two different points**—perfect for conduction velocity or other 
dual-recording experiments.

> **Note**: For 2-channel recordings on a computer, you’ll need either a 
> [stereo (2-channel) line input](http://en.wiki.backyardbrains.com/Testing_Stereo_Input_on_Your_Computer)  
> or a [USB sound card](https://griffintechnology.com/us/imic).  
> Most mobile devices only support **one channel** input.

If you discover a new approach or experiment for the 2-Channel SpikerBox, 
we’d love to hear about it!
