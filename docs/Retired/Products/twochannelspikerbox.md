### Overview

What can you do with **2 Channels**?
- **Record from multiple neural sources** simultaneously
- **Measure conduction velocity** (e.g. with earthworms!) to learn how fast action potentials travel

This expands on our original SpikerBox design and is just as easy to use. You can connect a laptop cable or a smartphone cable to listen to spikes on an external speaker, or watch them on your smartphone, iPad, or computer.

All our standard single-channel SpikerBox experiments are still possible, but with the 2-Channel SpikerBox, you can **take two measurements** at once.

> **Important**: For 2-channel recordings, you’ll need a laptop with either a  
> [2-channel (stereo) line input](http://en.wiki.backyardbrains.com/Testing_Stereo_Input_on_Your_Computer)  
> or a [usb sound card](https://griffintechnology.com/us/imic).  
> Mobile devices typically only allow one channel.

If you discover something new or develop a new 2-Channel experiment, we’d love to hear about it!
