# The Neuron SpikerBox

Record living neurons, hear what the brain sounds like, and directly record
Action Potentials directly your PC or mobile devices (Apple and Android).
Never before have powerful neuroscience tools been this accessible!

This kit is easy to use for beginners, but powerful enough to record
publication-ready results! This kit can turn any home or classroom into a
Ph.D. lab!

Order your kit today and begin performing your own experiments!

##### Conduction Velocity

With an earthworm, students will learn how fast action potentials travel down
neurons! This simple prep is a great place to get started experimenting!

##### Cockroaches!

Students will explore how neurons encode sensory information by performing
rate coding experiments with a cockroach leg!

##### Student-Guided Experiments

Get students excited to perform experiments on their prep and see what affects
the neuron's rate of firing!

##### USB Connection

Connect via USB to a laptop or computer and your Spike Recorder will
automatically detect the SpikerBox!

##### Follow the Rainbow

The expansion port allows endless experimentation... add in additional analog
channels, event markers, oscilloscopes, or breadboard for your own inventions!
