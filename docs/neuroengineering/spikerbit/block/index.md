# Getting Started with Spiker:bit Block Programming #

## Overview ##

In this guide, you’ll learn how to use your **Spiker:bit** and **micro:bit** to read **muscle (EMG)** and **heart (ECG/EKG)** signals and display them right on your micro:bit!

**You’ll need:**

- 1x Spiker:bit + 1x micro:bit (inserted into the Spiker:bit front slot)
- 3x BYB Large Muscle Electrodes
- 1x BYB Orange Electrode Cable
- 1x USB Cable

##  Reading a Muscle Signal (EMG)

The EMG signal measures the **electrical activity in your muscles**.  
The Spiker:bit automatically creates a variable called **`muscle power signal`** that stores this information so you can use it in your code.

### Step 1: Start the Muscle Recording

1. Open the **MakeCode editor**.  
2. Drag the block **“start muscle recording”** into the **“on start”** block.  
   - This sets up the micro:bit to communicate with the Spiker:bit.  
   - You only need to do this **once per project**.

### Step 2: Add Some Logic

1. From the **Logic** section, drag an **“if else”** block.  
2. Add a **“less than”** operator inside the condition.  
3. Compare the `muscle power signal` to a small number (like **10**) 

> **Note:** The muscle activation threshold (default: 10) can be adjusted based on individual reflex strength, electrodes placements, and muscle choice. Use a lower value for weaker signals and a higher one for stronger contractions.
4. From **Basic**, drag two **“show icon”** blocks:  
   -  Show a heart icon for rest  
   -  Show X icon for flex

## Connecting Muscles to Read an EMG Signal ##

Once your Spiker:Bit is powered and ready, it’s time to connect it to a muscle and see your own electrical activity in action!

Connect **two large motor electrodes** along a target muscle, the **forearm** works best for clear, easy-to-control signals. Clip the **two red leads** to these electrodes, and attach the **black ground** to an electrode behind your hand to keep the signal clean.   

![Placement of Electrodes]( ./emgToMicrobit.png)

Once the program is loaded, open **Show Data** to view your EMG signal in real time. Relaxed muscles stay near **0**, and a firm flex can rise to around **1000**, that’s your muscle’s electrical activity being measured live!

Use this range to adjust your **activation threshold** (default: **10**), set it lower for weaker signals and higher for stronger contractions. Finding the right value helps your readings stay stable and responsive.  


Now you can use standard **micro:bit code** to make your EMG signal do something fun, play a **sound**, move a **motor**, or trigger **lights** whenever you flex. Your body’s electricity becomes your new **controller**! The possibilities are endless!

## Reading a Heart Signal ECG ##

The Spiker:bit can also record ECG signals. This requires a different electrode placement and a minor modification to the code.

### Step 1: Electrode Placement for ECG

A common placement for a simple ECG reading (based on Einthoven's triangle) is:

1.  Ground (Black Clip): Back of the left hand or wrist.
2.  Positive (Red Clip): Inside of the right wrist or forearm.
3.  Negative (Other Red Clip): Inside of the left wrist or forearm.

### Step 2: Update the Code

1. Return to your MakeCode project.
2. In the on start block, replace start muscle recording with the **`start heart recording`** (ECG) block.
3. In the forever loop, replace the muscle power signal variable with the heartbeat signal (ECG) variable.
4. Download this new program to your micro:bit.


Open the "Show Data (Device)" graph. With the electrodes properly placed, you should now see a regular, rhythmic spike corresponding to your heartbeat.

Here's what the signal will look like once you're successful:

> **Troubleshooting Note:** If the spikes appear **inverted (pointing down)**, the **signal polarity** is reversed.  
> To fix this, **swap the two red alligator clips** on your wrists.

## Note on  MicroPython and JavaScript Editors

The MakeCode editor also supports text-based coding. You can toggle between 
**Blocks**, **JavaScript**, and **MicroPython** using the tabs at the top of the editor.

For this demo project, the block code converted into MicroPython looks like this:

and JavaScript looks like this:

> **Caution:** Converting complex **text-based code** (JavaScript or MicroPython) back to the **Block editor** may not always work correctly and can cause **data loss**.  
> It’s best to **save a separate copy** of your text-based code before switching modes.
