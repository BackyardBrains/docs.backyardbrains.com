Have you ever wondered how your neurons communicate with each other? It's not just electricity at play; neurons rely on a complex interplay of chemical messengers to convey messages and meanings. In this kit, we will be exploring both types of neurotransmitters - Inhibitory and Excitatory - in a cricket.

Earlier, we looked at different ways that neurons can spike, the rate that they spike at, and more, but now lets look at why and what provokes them to spike. Scientists in the 1800's had a debate with two leading theories; whether the neurons were fused together, or if there was space in between them. With their technology, they had no way of telling if there was a gap or not, which brings us to the 1950's when the first electron microscope was used in order to scan neurons. They found that there was a gap that is about 20nm wide, so what goes on in that gap?

In the synaptic gap, neurotransmitters are released by one neuron and received by another, facilitating communication and interpretation of signals between neurons. Each animal possesses a unique neural system, and the significance of various neurotransmitters can vary across species. What do these neurotransmitters actually do though, and how do they affect the post-synaptic neuron?

When a neurotransmitter reaches the post-synaptic neuron, it triggers one of two competing responses. Excitatory neurotransmitters stimulate the post-synaptic neuron to increase its firing rate, while inhibitory neurotransmitters suppress neuronal activity, causing it to fire less frequently. A post-synaptic neuron is recieving thousands of signals so how does it decide when it's going to spike from these neurotransmitters? It takes the average of all of the inputs, and if the average for the last couple of milliseconds reaches above the -50mV threshold, it will cause the neuron to spike.

When someone thinks of neurotransmitters, they think of chemicals that are complex, or hard to obtain, but they are in our every day lives. The two receptors we will focus on are the Acetylcholine receptor and the Glutamate receptor. First we will be using Nicotine from a cigarette; Nicotine mimics Acetylcholine's response when it binds to the nicotine receptors. Next we will use Monosodiumglutamate (MSG), which is glutamate with a single sodium ion, making it a salt. MSG is commonly used in cooking to add an umami flavor, and when ingested doesn't affect your neurons. Somethings in your everyday lives are neurotransmitters that you might not even think! Caffeine is one of the most widely consumed psychoactive substances in the world. It primarily works by blocking adenosine receptors in the brain. Adenosine is a neurotransmitter that promotes sleep and relaxation. By inhibiting its action, caffeine prevents the onset of drowsiness, making you feel more alert and awake.

Glutamate in human systems is an excitatory neurotransmitter, but every animal's system is different. For crickets, glutamate does the exact opposite than it does in a human, it inhibits the production of action potentials. Nicotine when in the bloodstream makes it's way up to the brain, and when it reaches it, it binds with the Nicotine Acetylcholine receptors. These receptors are very diverse on which neuron they're on, and can be found in many different systems in the brain. When nicotine binds to Nicotine Acetylcholine receptors (nAChR); for a couple of milliseconds the nAChR opens their positive ion channels producing an action potential. After a couple of milliseconds, the ACh either returns to its resting potential, closing the channels, or it becomes desensitized, and becomes unresponsive to their agonist. This system is why nicotine can become so addictive. Nicotine can be on a neuron that releases dopamine, and if the neuron becomes densitized it will not fire to anything but nicotine making a strong motivation for nicotine. Glutamate itself is a neurotransmitter, and directly binds to the receptor performing it's action as a chemical messenger. In crickets, it acts as an inhibitor, but how can adding a chemical into a neuron, make it more negative, as most ion channels in neurons are positive. The inhibitory neurons will *inhibit* the ion channels, making them let less positive ion into the cell. This reduces the chance of depolarization, making it harder for the neuron to create an action potential.

In this kit we will be inducing both neurotransmitter responses in a cricket, and watch the whole time.  

"The main endogenous agonist for all of these nAChRs is acetylcholine (ACh), but nicotine obtained exogenously from tobacco also is an agonist. Upon binding an agonist, a nAChR briefly enters the open conformation of the ion channel, which provides a water-filled pathway through the membrane for cations. After a couple milliseconds, the receptor undergoes another conformational change that closes the channel, and the receptor returns to the resting conformation or enters into a desensitized conformation that is unresponsive to agonists. The speed of activation, the ionic current, the rates of desensitization and recovery from desensitization, the pharmacology and the regulatory controls of the agonist response all depend on the subunit composition of the nAChRs as well as other local factors."

# Description #



# Instructions # 

## Nicotine Solution Preparation

1. Remove the filter from a cigarette by pinching and pulling it off.
2. Place the filter-less cigarette into a 10 mL falcon tube.
3. Fill the tube with saline up to the 10 mL mark.
4. Let it soak overnight to extract the nicotine.

## MSG Solution Preparation

1. Fill a tube with saline up to the 10 mL mark (MSG is already in the tube for your convenience).
2. Shake the tube until the MSG is completely dissolved.

## Cricket Preparation

1. Place a cricket in the freezer for about 3 minutes. Ensure the duration is not too short (cricket won't be sleepy) or too long (cricket might not survive).

## Placing the Electrodes

1. Once the cricket is sleepy, insert one electrode into its abdomen.
2. Insert the second electrode two spiracles away from the first one.

## Setting Up the SpikerBox

1. Turn on the SpikerBox and connect it to your tablet or smartphone.
2. Wait approximately 2 minutes for the cricket to wake up.
3. Gently blow on its abdomen to confirm itâ€™s awake. You should see spikes on the app if it is.

## Injecting and Observing

### Injecting the Solutions

1. Use a new syringe to inject 0.03 mL of the nicotine solution into one cricket.
2. Use a new syringe to inject 0.03 mL of the MSG solution into another cricket.
3. Use a new syringe to inject 0.03 mL of plain saline into a third cricket as a control.

### Observing Neuronal Response

1. Observe the cricket's neuronal activity on the app.
2. When injecting MSG, expect to see inhibitory behaviors.
3. When injecting nicotine, expect to see excitatory behaviors.
4. When injecting just saline, expect no change in spiking behaviors.
5. Record any changes in spike frequency or patterns after injection.

## Sharing Data and Conducting Multiple Trials

1. **Importance of Multiple Trials**:
   - Conducting multiple trials ensures the reliability and reproducibility of experimental results.
   - Different groups may observe variations due to biological variability or experimental conditions.

2. **Collaborative Data Sharing**:
   - Share experimental data with classmates to increase sample size and verify trends.
   - Utilize a shared spreadsheet to compile and analyze collective data.

3. **Class Data Analysis**:
   - Combine data from multiple trials to identify consistent patterns and draw robust conclusions.
   - Discuss findings as a class to interpret results and consider potential implications.

4. **Critical Thinking and Discussion**:
   - Encourage critical analysis of discrepancies or unexpected results between different experimental groups.
   - Foster discussions on possible reasons for variations and refine experimental techniques for future trials.

## Safety and Ethics

1. Wear gloves and safety goggles when preparing and injecting solutions.
2. Dispose of syringes and biological materials properly.

### Be Kind to Crickets

1. Discuss the ethical use of animals in research.
2. Ensure students understand the importance of treating the crickets humanely and minimizing their discomfort.
