## Project Overview
Have you ever been on a bus ride that seems to stretch forever? You reach for your earphones, eager to drown out the monotony with some tunes, only to find the first few songs falling flat. It’s frustrating, right? Each time you want to skip a track, it's a whole ordeal: fishing out your phone, unlocking it, navigating to the music app—it's enough to make you want to skip the skipping altogether. But what if there was a way to bypass those duds with just a clench of your jaw (something you're probably doing anyways)? Imagine this scenario: you settle into your seat, close your eyes, and with a subtle flex of your jaw muscles,  seamlessly transition from a lackluster tune to something that really hits the spot. No more reaching for your phone.

What if that could be a reality? Here is what we came up with:

## Materials Needed
Using simple block codes and imagination, we
turned our idea into reality.For this project, we need
- 1x micro:bit and neuro:bit
- 1x audio jack with alligator clips- for measuring EMG in jaw muscles
- 2x Jumper wires - connecting pinhead with neuro:bit and alligator clips
- 1x wired headphones
- 2x alligator clips
- 1x Grove connector

Optional
3D printer for printing plastic belt clips to store our micro:bit and wires

## ABOUT CODE

BeatBite uses a simple micro:bit setup and a few cables to bring this simple idea into reality! This is how it works:
