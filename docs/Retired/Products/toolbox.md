When we show off our products, toolbox in hand, people often remark:  
“Wow… You’ve got a full lab in there!” It’s true, and now, you can too!

This lab contains the same gear that we often use when we demonstrate our products or research remotely. With this, you’ll have a rather sophisticated mobile neuroscience lab.

### Product Details

This toolbox contains many of our core products in one portable box:
A Neuron SpikerBox Pro, a Muscle SpikerBox Pro, a Human-Human Interface, a RoboRoach, and our Heart and Brain SpikerBox. This ships with 100 Patch Electrodes and all the cables you need. Now do some outreach, make some discoveries, and share your results!
