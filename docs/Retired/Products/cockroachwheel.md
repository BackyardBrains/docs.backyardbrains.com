### Description

The RoachWheel is a great companion for your cockroach colony—both scientific
and fun! It can help make your classroom pets more entertaining. After all,
**a cockroach doesn’t get more adorable** than when running on a wheel!

In the near future, the wheel will also support an “activity tracker” add-on.
When paired with an Arduino, you can monitor the activity cycle of your
cockroach colony or even an individual cockroach’s circadian rhythms. The
additional sensor attachment and experiment write-up on circadian rhythms are
coming soon.
