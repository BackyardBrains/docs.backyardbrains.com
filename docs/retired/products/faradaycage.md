### Overview

Are you getting a lot of noise in your invertebrate recordings? Do you sometimes pick up stray radio stations? While we all love listening to music, we also like having clean, noise-free recordings. If your SpikerBox recordings are full of noise, then the Faraday Cage may be what you are looking for. This is especially important when attempting to record from Earthworms (which, for reasons we don’t understand, make terrific antennas).

### Product Details

Our Faraday Cage is made in-house from basswood and wire mesh screening. To use your Faraday Cage, put your Spikerbox directly in the cage during an experiment. In the earthworm experiment mentioned above, only place your earthworm prep and electrodes inside. There are many uses for the Faraday Cage… what will you discover and use it for?

### Kit Contents:
	* 1x Faraday Cage, preassembled and ready to use
	* 1x Alligator Clip, to ground Faraday Cage to your SpikerBox
