# Getting Started with Neuro:Bit Python Programming #

## Overview ##

Python is a programming language that can be used with the Neuro:Bit to easily develop Brain Machine Interfaces.  It is a powerful language, easy to learn, and a great way to get started with Neuro:Bit. [ Greg Stopped here ]

## Software Set-up ## 

To code your project, you will need to head to the [micro:bit Python Editor](https://python.microbit.org/v/3/ideas) This is the software Microsoft developed to code the micro:bit with. It will open with the micro:bit library already imported, and a loop in place. Delete the code inside the workspace and you can start.

## Read EMG Signal into a Variable ##

Variables store information in your code so you can easily access it.   We will need to create a variable to hold the values coming in from the EMG Signal.  Navigate to the Variables section and make a variable called "currentSignal". [Greg stopped here ]
