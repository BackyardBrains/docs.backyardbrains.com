# Use of Our Images, Media & Schematics

We are open-source, so you are free to use our images, media, and schematics without requesting permission. This includes using them to build your own SpikerBoxes or other related projects.

However, we kindly ask that you acknowledge your creation and share any links or media with us once your project is complete. This allows us to see what you've built and possibly feature your work on our blog.

Thank you for supporting open-source science and innovation!
