Are you an artist or engineer that has a killer idea for a new interface? With
the Muscle SpikerShield bundle, you have everything you need to start your
developing your own ideas, learn about the exciting field of neuroprosthetics,
or use your muscle activity to create any human-machine interface your
creative mind desires.

### Product Details

This kit includes our fully assembled Muscle SpikerShield, a USB cable, and an
Arduino. The Arduino comes preloaded with code to perform our "Getting
Started" demo where you can control a bank of LEDs with your own muscle
activity. Everything you need right out of the box! Just plug your Muscle
SpikerShield into a USB power source (such as a computer or battery) and you
are ready to go!

This bundle also comes with 2 different types of electrodes! For larger muscle
recordings in your arms and legs, you get the fashionable sticker-patch
electrodes. You also get our very fancy, brass popsicle-stick electrodes,
ideal for use with your smaller muscles, like your eyeblink and finger
muscles.
