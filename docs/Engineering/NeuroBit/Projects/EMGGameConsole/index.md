## Project Overview

The "EMG Game Console" is a platform for creating retro games that you can play with your muscles _(and maybe even your eyes)_. We‚Äôve created an example game, but feel free to come up with your own ideas and extensions! üïπÔ∏è

In our Tug of War game, neuro:bit devices measure EMG signals from the forearm muscles of two players, simulating a tug of war game both on a screen and on a physical model.

Electrodes on your forearm measure EMG signals, essentially interrupting the brain‚Äôs message to your muscles when you contract them, and send this data to the neuro:bit.

The neuro:bit then uses math ‚ú® to calculate the position of a flag on the tug of war rope and filters out any janky movement.

## Materials Needed

- 2 x neuro:bits
- 2 x micro:bits
- 1 x SG90 servo motor kit with horns and screws
- 1 x Seeed Wio Terminal
- 1 x microSD card _(1GB is sufficient)_
- 1 x 3D printed parts
- 1 x A piece of string
- 1 x Grove cable
- 4 x AA batteries
- 2 x BYB muscle cables
- 6 x gel electrodes
- 1 x USB C cable
- 1 x micro USB cable
- 1 x Power bank / external USB power supply
- 1 x Arduino IDE v2
- ‚àû x Enthusiasm üòÑ

## 3D Printing

Before connecting the electronics, we should slice and start printing the files. If you don't have a 3D printer _(bummer)_, you can still play the game on the Wio Terminal. If you don‚Äôt have the Wio Terminal, you can still create the physical extension _(or do both if you have both)_.

1. 3D print all parts located in the `TugOfWarGame` folder of the attached ZIP file. Apply supports as needed.

![Tug Of War Game Plate Image path/to/your/image.png)

2. _If you don‚Äôt have the Wio Terminal:_ 3D print all parts in the `GameConsole` folder. Note that some files need to be printed twice, and you need to apply supports.

![Game Console Plate Image path/to/your/image.png)

3. Thoroughly clean the parts from the supports after printing.

## Connections

1. Plug the two micro:bits into their slots on the neuro:bit boards _(facing away from the neuro:bit)_. Insert two AA batteries into each neuro:bit.

2. Cut the red _(power)_ wire of the Grove cable. We want to power the Wio Terminal externally.

![Grove Cable Image path/to/your/image.png)

3. Plug one side of the cable into one of the neuro:bit's "digital" Grove ports _(the one with the SCL and SDA - i2c pins)_. This micro:bit is now the "right one".

![Microbit Grove Image path/to/your/image.png)

4. Plug the other side of the cable into the matching i2c Grove port on the Wio Terminal _(the left one when the screen is up)_.

![Wio Terminal Grove Image path/to/your/image.png)

5. Insert the microSD card into your computer and transfer the files from the `Assets/bmp` folder of the attachment.

![Illustrations Image Illustration.png)

6. Insert the microSD card into the Wio Terminal's slot beside the power switch _(pins toward the screen/facing up)_.

## Console Assembly

1. Attach the neuro:bit holders to the stand's flat side, with the openings facing outward.

2. Slide the plates into the grooves in the neuro:bit holders and the stand to lock them in place.

3. Insert the switches, ensuring the higher side is toward the neuro:bit sign and they are in the OFF position.

![Switches Image path/to/your/image.png)

4. Insert both neuro:bits into their holders _(the right one goes to the right one)_ with the ports facing outward. Angle them slightly and push them in. This might take a few tries, so do it one by one, paying attention not to move the switches.

5. Snap the Wio Terminal into the display holder.

![Display Holder Image path/to/your/image.png)

6. Position the display holder so that the blue button is in the top left corner and slide it onto the stand.

## Tug of War Extension Assembly

1. Follow the pictures to assemble the tug of war part.

![Tug of War Image](Assembly1.png)
![Tug of War Image](Assembly2.png)
![Tug of War Image](Assembly3.png)
![Tug of War Image](Assembly4.png)

2. Rotate the gear in the tug of war part and snap the white servo motor horn in place _(a screwdriver might be helpful)_.

![Tug of War Image](Assembly5.png)

3. Connect the servo motor‚Äôs cable to the right neuro:bit, ensuring the letters on the micro:bit port _(BlackRedYellow)_ match the colors on the cable.

![Servo Connection Image   path)

4. Flash the temporary code using the micro:bit Python Editor from the file servo_calibration.py to the right neuro:bit. This will center the servo to 90¬∞.

5. Put the servo in its slot orienting it so it lines up with the horn, carefully centering the gear as well.

![Tug of War Image](Assembly6.png)

5. Secure the servo motor in place with screws. Press upwards on the gear to ensure the horn is tight on the servo.

![Tug of War Image](Assembly7.png)

6. Cut a piece of string a little over 10 cm.

7. Thread one end of the string through the hole in the stickman‚Äôs hand and tie a knot. Thread the other end of the string through both holes in the flag and then through the hole in the other stickman‚Äôs hand, tying it in a knot.

8. Position the flag so that its bottom points to a mark on the tug of war part.

![Tug of War Image](AssemblyComplete.png)

9. Done, now the angle of the servo should be proportional to the position of the flag!

## Software

1. Go to the [micro:bit Python Editor](https://python.microbit.org) _(use Chrome for easier device connection rather than transferring the HEX file)_.

2. Open the `left_microbit.py` file in the lower right corner.

3. Flash the left micro:bit by plugging it in using a micro USB cable and connecting to it in the lower left corner of the editor. Click on "Send to micro:bit" after connecting.

4. Open a fresh [micro:bit Python Editor](https://python.microbit.org) instance in a new tab and close the previous one.

5. Open the `right_microbit.py` file, as before.

6. Flash the right micro:bit by repeating the procedure.

7. Open the `wio_terminal.ino` file in Arduino IDE.

8. Connect the Wio Terminal to your computer using a USB C cable _(you can disconnect the micro:bits)_.

9. Follow the [Wio Terminal guide](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Wio-Terminal-Getting-Started) to set up your IDE for programming it.

10. Flash the code to the Wio Terminal, and voila, you‚Äôre good to go! üöÄ

## Operation

Once everything is assembled and coded, both players should follow these steps:

1. Place one gel electrode on the back of your hand _(any bony part without muscle interference will do, like your elbow)_. Bend your ring and pinkie fingers while you search for the muscle that contracts on your forearm with the other hand. Place two electrodes on that muscle.

![Tug of War Image path/to/your/image.png)

2. Connect the black cable clip to the electrode on the back of your hand and the two red cable clips to the other two electrodes.

![Tug of War Image path/to/your/image.png)

3. Connect the orange cables to the neuro:bits, with the left player _(red cable)_ connecting to the left one and the right player _(green cable)_ connecting to the right one.

![Tug of War Image path/to/your/image.png)

4. Plug the USB C cable into the Wio Terminal and the other end into a power bank.

![Tug of War Image path/to/your/image.png)

5. Turn on the switches on both neuro:bits.

![Tug of War Image path/to/your/image.png)

6. When the display turns on, press the blue button to select the game.

![Tug of War Image path/to/your/image.png)

7. Press the black button on the bottom of the micro:bit and then squeeze your muscle as hard as you can until the red tick mark appears on the micro:bit.

![Tug of War Image path/to/your/image.png)

8. Now you can play by squeezing your wrists - the stronger you squeeze, the more the flag will move in your direction. Enjoy the game that NEVER ENDS. ü§ó
