Ever been on a bus ride that seems to stretch on forever?
You reach for your earphones, eager to drown out the
monotony with some tunes, only to find the first few songs
falling flat. It’s frustrating, right? Each time you want
to skip a track, it's a whole ordeal: fishing out your
phone, unlocking it, navigating to the music app—it's
enough to make you want to skip the skipping altogether.
But what if there was a way to bypass those duds with just
a clench of your jaw? Imagine this scenario: you settle
into your seat, close your eyes, and with a subtle flex of
your jaw muscles, seamlessly transition from a lackluster
tune to something that really hits the spot. No more
reaching for your phone.
What if, per say, that could be a reality? Here is what we
came up with:

BeatBite Control uses a simple Micro:bit setup and a few
cables to bring this simple idea into reality! This is how
it works:

Using a few simple block codes and good imagination, we
turned our idea into reality.For this project, we need
-micro:bit-device that could be programmed in numerous ways
-neuro:bit-tool that lets anyone easily build brain-machine
interfaces
-audio jack with alligator clips-are used to measure EMG in
jaw muscles

-Jumper wire-with pin head that connects jumper wires and
neuro:bit
-two jumper wires-that connect jumper wire with pin head
and alligator clips
-wired headphones
-two alligator clips-that connect jumper wires and
headphones
Using the micro:bit built in block code, we made a program
for this project. For design, we used a 3D printer to print
us plastic belt clips in which we could store our micro:bit
and wires
