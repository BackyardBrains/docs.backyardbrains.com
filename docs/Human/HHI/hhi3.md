# Human-Human Interface (HHI) User Manual (v3.0 -  2025)

## Overview

**Connecting with other people takes on a whole new meaning with our Human-Human Interface (HHI)!**

The HHI is an educational tool designed to demonstrate the principles of neurophysiology and bioelectric communication. By capturing electrical signals generated by one person's muscles (the "Master") and transmitting them to another person's muscles (the "Minion"), the HHI effectively allows one person to control the movements of another's arm. This fascinating device bridges the gap between theoretical neuroscience concepts and real-world applications, making it an ideal resource for educators seeking to inspire students in the field of neuroscience.

## What's New in Version 3.0

The HHI 3.0 introduces new features that expand its educational potential:

- **Wireless Connectivity:** Configure the device via Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to connect over a network, enabling remote control capabilities.
- **Multiple Operating Modes:** Three operational modes allow for customizable experiments:
  - **Mode 0:** Traditional HHI operation without the need for an app or internet connection.
  - **Mode 1 & 2:** Remote control and remote minion modes, allowing for control over the internet or within the same room.
  - **Mode 3:** Custom stimulation protocols with adjustable parameters for advanced experiments.
- **Enhanced Educational Applications:** The new modes enable exploration of additional neuroscience experiments, including remote neural control and custom stimulation protocols.

## Setting Up the HHI

### 1. Inserting the Battery

- Locate the battery compartment on the bottom of the device.
- Insert a 9V battery, ensuring proper polarity.

### 2. Connecting the Master (EMG Recording)

- **Electrode Placement (Master):**
  - Place two electrode patches on the inside of the forearm, about two finger widths apart.
  - Place a third electrode on the back of the hand (ground reference).
- **Cable Connection:**
  - Connect the orange EMG input cable to the orange jack labeled "Master."
  - Attach the two red alligator clips to the electrodes on the forearm.
  - Attach the black alligator clip to the electrode on the back of the hand.

### 3. Initial Device Activation

- Turn the Power/Intensity knob clockwise until you hear a click—the device is now on.
- The Power LED should illuminate, indicating the device is powered.

### 4. Observing EMG Signals

- When the Master flexes their forearm muscles, the LED bar on the device will light up from green to red, indicating the strength of the EMG signal.
- Use the Sensitivity Button to adjust the threshold required to trigger stimulation (more presses increase the difficulty).

### 5. Connecting the Minion (Stimulation Output)

  - Attach the alligator clips to the electrodes on the Minion's forearm (color does not affect functionality).

### 6. Adjusting Stimulation Intensity

- With the device on and both participants connected, have the Master flex their muscles to light up the red LEDs.
- Slowly turn the Power/Intensity knob clockwise to increase stimulation intensity.
- **Important:** Increase intensity gradually. The Minion should feel the stimulation but not experience discomfort.

## Operating the HHI

### Adjusting Sensitivity (Master)

- Use the Sensitivity Button to set the EMG signal threshold:
  - Pressing the button cycles through sensitivity levels.
  - A higher threshold requires stronger muscle contractions to trigger stimulation.
