# Return Policy #

You can return unopened products for up to 90 days for a full refund. If you did open it, and still want to return it. That is OK, so long as it is still in working order. We do charge a 15% restocking fee, and we cannot refund consumable items such as electrode pads.

 

Please email us at hello@backyardbrains.com so we can take the necessary steps. 


Once we receive the kits, we will refund the credit card used for the order, the total amount of the products minus the difference of any consumables used, and our restocking fee.
