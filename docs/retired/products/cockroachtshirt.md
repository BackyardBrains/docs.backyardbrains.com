When we wore these shirts to demos, people kept asking if they could buy one.
Now you can.  
Just [e-mail us](mailto:hello@backyardbrains.com) with your color and size.  
Each shirt is DIY-printed on a hand press by our local artist, Patrick Goussy.
Made to order while we learn the ropes of textile manufacturing and shipping.
