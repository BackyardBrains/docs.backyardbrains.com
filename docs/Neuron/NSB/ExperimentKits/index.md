# Neuropharmacology Kit #

Pic

## How many should I order for my classroom? ## 

| Item | Amount in One Kit|
|----------|----------|
| MSG | 0.1g|
| Cigarette | 1 |
| Syringes | 15 |
| Falcon tube | 3 |
| Saline Solution | 25mL |

This kit includes enough syringes to do the experiment in five groups. 
A classroom of 15 students would be separated into five groups of three, as each group needs three syringes. 

# Description #

Engage your students with a hands-on neuropharmacology experiment that explores the effects of nicotine and MSG (glutamate) on cricket neuronal activity. By injecting crickets with these substances and observing their neuronal responses, students gain practical experience with key scientific concepts. This experiment demonstrates how different neurotransmitters influence neuronal communication, providing insights into the roles of inhibitory and excitatory neurotransmitters. The kit includes all necessary materials and easy-to-follow instructions, making it simple for teachers to implement. Designed to align with curriculum standards, this interactive activity helps students understand complex biological processes in an accessible and engaging way

# Instructions # 

Nicotine Solution Prep
  Rip off the filter by pinching and pulling.
  Put the filter-less cigarette in a 10 mL falcon tube.
  Fill the tube with saline up to the 10 mL mark.
  Let it soak for at least overnight to extract the nicotine.

MSG Solution:
  Fill the tube with saline up to the 10 mL mark.
    *we have already put the MSG in the tube for your convience 
  Shake the tube until the MSG is completely dissolved.
  
Cricket Prep:
  Put a cricket in the freezer for about 3 minutes. Too short, and it won't be sleepy; too long, and it might not make it.
Place the Electrodes:
  Once the cricket is sleepy, put one electrode in its abdomen.
  Place the second electrode two spiracles away from the first one.
Set Up the Spikerbox:
  Turn on the spikerbox and connect it to the tablet or smartphone.
  Wait about 2 minutes for the cricket to wake up.
  Blow gently on its abdomen to make sure it's awake. You should see spikes on the app if it is.

Injecting and Observing
Inject the Solutions:
  With a new syringe Inject one cricket with 0.03 mL of the nicotine solution.
  With a new syringe Inject another cricket with 0.03 mL of the MSG solution.
  With a new syringe Inject a third cricket with 0.03 mL of plain saline as a control.
Watch the Neuronal Response:
  Observe the cricket's neuronal activity on the app.
  When injecting Glutamate you expect to see inhibitory behaviors
  When injecting Nicotine you expect to see excitatory behaviors
  When injecting just saline you expect to see no changing in spiking behaviors
  Record any changes in spike frequency or patterns after injection.

Safety and Ethics
  Wear gloves and safety goggles when preparing and injecting solutions.
  Dispose of syringes and biological materials properly.
Be Kind to Crickets:
  Talk about the ethical use of animals in research.
  Make sure students understand the importance of treating the crickets humanely and minimizing their discomfort.
